# funix_lab_14_covid-tracker

A basic covid-19 tracker in JavaScript 👶🏻

Actually, I referred to the documentation and GitHub here:
https://www.makeuseof.com/build-covid-19-tracker-in-javascript/
However, I have enhanced it on my own and written the code in my own style ✍️

This is one of the lab exercises I have to complete during the process of obtaining the Fullstack certificate from FUNIX 🎓.
